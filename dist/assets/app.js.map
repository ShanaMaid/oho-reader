It can be a\n\t//                      function or an array of strings.\n\t//          space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n\t//                      of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n\t//                      be packed without extra whitespace.

If it is a string (such as \"\\t\" or \"&nbsp;\"),\n\t//                      it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n\t//          This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n\t//          When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n\t//          method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n\t//          stringified.

It will be passed the\n\t//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n\t//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n\t//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n\t//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\t\n\t//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n\t//          used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n\t//          such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n\t//          stringified.\n\t\n\t//          Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n\t//          functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n\t//          dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n\t//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\t\n\t//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\t\n\t//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n\t//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n\t//          easier to read.\n\t\n\t//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n\t//          be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n\t//          the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\t\n\t//          Example:\n\t\n\t//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}]);\n\t//          // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\t\n\t//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}], null, \"\\t\");\n\t//          // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\t\n\t//          text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n\t//              return this[key] instanceof Date\n\t//                  ? \"Date(\" + this[key] + \")\"\n\t//                  : value;\n\t//          });\n\t//          // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\t\n\t//      JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n\t//          This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n\t//          It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\t\n\t//          The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n\t//          transform the results.

This file provides the ES5 JSON capability to ES3 systems.\n//  If a project might run on IE8 or earlier, then this file should be included.\n//  This file does nothing on ES5 systems.\n\n//      JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)\n//          value       any JavaScript value, usually an object or array.\n//          replacer    an optional parameter that determines how object\n//                      values are stringified for objects. It can be a\n//                      function or an array of strings.\n//          space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n//                      of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n//                      be packed without extra whitespace. If it is a number,\n//                      it will specify the number of spaces to indent at each\n//                      level. If it is a string (such as \"\\t\" or \"&nbsp;\"),\n//                      it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n//          This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n//          When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n//          method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n//          stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n//          value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n//          or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n//          will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n//          bound to the value.\n\n//          For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\n//              Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n//                  function f(n) {\n//                      // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n//                      return (n < 10)\n//                          ? \"0\" + n\n//                          : n;\n//                  }\n//                  return this.getUTCFullYear()   + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMonth() + 1) + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCDate())      + \"T\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCHours())     + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMinutes())   + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCSeconds())   + \"Z\";\n//              };\n\n//          You can provide an optional replacer method. It will be passed the\n//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\n//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n//          used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n//          such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n//          stringified.\n\n//          Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n//          functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n//          dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\n//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n//          easier to read.\n\n//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n//          be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n//          the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}]);\n//          // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}], null, \"\\t\");\n//          // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n//              return this[key] instanceof Date\n//                  ? \"Date(\" + this[key] + \")\"\n//                  : value;\n//          });\n//          // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n//      JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n//          This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n//          It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n//          The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n//          transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n//          and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n//          If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n//          If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will\n//          // be converted to Date objects.\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) {\n//              var a;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\") {\n//                  a =\n//   /^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})T(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}(?:\\.\\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);\n//                  if (a) {\n//                      return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],\n//                          +a[5], +a[6]));\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse('[\"Date(09/09/2001)\"]', function (key, value) {\n//              var d;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\" &&\n//                      value.slice(0, 5) === \"Date(\" &&\n//                      value.slice(-1) === \")\") {\n//                  d = new Date(value.slice(5, -1));\n//                  if (d) {\n//                      return d;\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//  This is a reference implementation.
